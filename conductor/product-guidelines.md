# Product Guidelines

## Design Philosophy
- **Aesthetic**: Brutalist, Visual Rich, "Wow" factor.
- **Micro-interactions**: High emphasis on hover effects, smooth transitions, and dynamic elements.
- **Responsiveness**: Fluid layouts that adapt seamlessly.

## Development Standards
- **Quality**: "Logic - Safe - Visually Great".
- **Safety**: Strict TypeScript usage. No `any` types unless absolutely necessary.
- **Cleanliness**: Modular components, clear separation of concerns (Logic vs. View).

## User Experience
- **Focus**: Distinct paths for different user needs (e.g., "Terminal View" vs. "Visual View").
- **Interaction**: Intuitive onboarding flows and proactive communication interfaces.
