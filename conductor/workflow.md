# Workflow

## 1. Specification (Spec)
Before writing code for a complex feature:
1.  **Analyze**: Understand the requirements and the existing codebase.
2.  **Define**: Write a clear specification in `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/spec.md`.

## 2. Planning (Plan)
1.  **Breakdown**: Divide the spec into phased tasks in `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/plan.md`.
2.  **Verify**: Ensure the plan covers all edge cases and integration points.

## 3. Implementation (Build)
1.  **Execute**: Implement tasks one by one.
2.  **Test**: Verify each task before moving to the next.
3.  **Refactor**: Clean up code as you go, adhering to `product-guidelines.md`.

## 4. Verification
1.  **Review**: Check against the original spec.
2.  **Polish**: Ensure the visual output matches the "Visual Greatness" standard.
